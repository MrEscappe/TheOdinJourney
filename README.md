# Hello Everyone, Welcome to my The Odin Project Journey Repository.

This repository will contain all the projects that I will be doing while following the Odin Project Curriculum.

## My History so far:

I started learning programming last year, originally choosing The Odin Project (TOP). To be honest, I couldn't force myself to finish the Ruby on Rails journey once I hit a roadblock. I decided to take a pause and look into other topics since I realized I wasn't quite ready to go into that particular issue. During this period, learning Blender and Unreal turned out to be fun experiences.

I've now decided to pick up programming again and continue my learning process. I've made the decision to start again from scratch so that I may build a strong foundation before exploring more complicated issues.

## About me:

My name is José Sérgio, 30 years old from Brazil! I'm a self-taught programmer and I've been learning programming for the past year. I'm currently working as a 3D Artist and I'm looking to transition into the programming field.

## The learning so far:

I'm almost finished with the Foundation Course. Since I had already gone through this section before, it was easy to do it again, and it served as an excellent reminder.

## The Projects:

### Foundation:

All this projects were done in the last year, so I dind't put in my repository again, but I did it local to refresh my memory.
